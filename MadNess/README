Salut!

This is my March Madness site, built on pure servlets and the Derby embedded
database.  It's a scoring interface for an NCAA pool, allowing players (users)
to be created, who can then log in and pick their favorite teams to win.  An
administrator is responsible for defining the teams and entering the winners
for each subsequent game.  Players can then watch their scores increase in the
Scoreboard page.

Included you'll find all the sources, including the relevant classes from the
elseforif-servlet JAR, and the associated Javadocs, as well as the WAR file.

To run the application, first create the directory "/var/derby" and make sure
it is writable by your servlet container, drop the WAR into your "webapps"
directory, and then enter a URL like this into your browser:

  http://localhost:8080/madness/home

If you are using Windows, you'll have to expand the WAR first and change the
path to Derby's working directory, which is defined in the "web.xml" file as
init-param "data-files-dir".

In any case, once the application has started up successfully, you should
edit "web.xml" and change the parameter "rebuild-database" to "false".
Otherwise, the database will be recreated each time you run the app'.

(If you want to connect to Derby while the application is running, you can
change the "database-url" setting to the one commented out.  Using that
connection URL will cause Derby engine to start up in client/server mode.)

Another feature of this site is that it will send certain emails to all active
players, at the bidding of administrator users.  This will fail unless you
change the "smtp-host" setting (see also "sender-email") to point to an
accessible SMTP server.

Hope you enjoy it!
